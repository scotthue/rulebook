\part{Amendments}

The numbers below refer to sections in the current IUF Rulebook, which at the time of publication, is the ``2015 Preliminary Version'' from October 2015. For the sake of accuracy, both the number and the name of the referenced IUF Rulebook section will be written below. These amendments replace subsection 4.2.1 and section 6.15 of the 2015 IUF Rulebook in their entirety.

\amend{4.2.1 Ungeared Awards}{Ungeared Champion}
At NAUCC, for each gender (male and female) where there are five or more geared riders in an Unlimited event, the fastest ungeared rider from that gender will be awarded with the North American Ungeared Champion title for that event.
The next two ungeared riders from each gender should also be recognized with an award for second and third place, respectively, in that event.
This is only for the expert classification, not for Age Groups.
