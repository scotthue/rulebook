The 2016 Rulebook Amendments cannot be used as an independent document; they must be used in conjunction with the 2015 IUF Rulebook.
This document describes where the Unicycling Society of America chooses to differ from the IUF Rulebook for their competitions.
This document is comprised of two parts: Part 1, General Rules and Definitions, and Part 2, Amendments.
Part 1 is a complete section and replaces Part 1 in the IUF Rulebook in its entirety.
Part 2 is a list of amendments and must be used in reference to the current IUF Rulebook.

The most current IUF Rulebook can always be found at \url{https://unicycling.org/files/iuf-rulebook-current.pdf}.
