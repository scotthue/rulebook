\singlechapter{Amendments}

The numbers below refer to sections in the current IUF Rulebook, at the time of publication. For the sake of clarity, both the number and the name of the referenced IUF Rulebook section will be written below. These amendments replace sections of the IUF Rulebook in their entirety.

\section{IUF Requirements for Continental Championships}
Throughout the IUF Rulebook there are various additional specifications, rules, and requirements for Continental Championships.
This amendment document recognizes that while NAUCC is the Championship event for the North American Continent, these additional stipulations were generally written with much larger Continental Championships in mind.
As such, all additional specifications, rules, and requirements for Continental Championships listed in the IUF Rulebook are treated simply as recommendations for NAUCC.

\amend{3D.6 Ungeared Awards}{Ungeared Champion}
At NAUCC, for each gender (male and female) there shall be an ``ungeared'' and ``geared'' category for each road event in which there are both ungeared and geared riders.
For each event, if there are geared and ungeared riders both categories will be awarded a North American champion.

\amend{6B.6.1 Group Freestyle Restrictions}{Group Freestyle}
Group freestyle is divided into two categories: Club and Group.
Each rider may enter each category (Club and Group) only once.
For example: a rider can be in a Club routine and a Group routine, but not two Group Routines.

A rider may appear in a second Group Freestyle performance with permission of the Chief Judge, to replace a rider due to illness, injury or other mishap.

\subsection{Group}

\subsection{Club}
Minimum of three riders. Must be a USA Affiliated Club, and all riders must be members of said club.
