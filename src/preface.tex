The 2016 USA Rulebook is not an independent document and cannot be used on its own.
The USA Rulebook is based upon the current IUF Rulebook and in an attempt to simplify things, this document only lists the differences between the two rulebook instead of copying the IUF Rulebook and making changes as seen fit.
It is comprised of two parts: Part 1, General Rules and Definitions, and Part 2, Amendments.
Part 1 is a complete section and replaces Part 1 in the IUF Rulebook in its entirety.
Part 2 is a list of amendments and must be used in reference to the current IUF Rulebook.

The most current IUF Rulebook can always be found at \url{https://unicycling.org/files/iuf-rulebook-current.pdf}.
